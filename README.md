# Supermarket_Database_Management_Systetm
A basic DBMS system for a chain of grocery stores.

This repository contains a 'Code.sql' file that holds the code to create a Database Management System.
All the relations have been normalised to the 3nf form.
Triggers have been written to update the inventory whenever a purchase is made.

The files 'ER' and 'Schema' show the Entity Relationship and Schema models.
